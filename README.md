# puzzle solver
Sample Solver for NYT spelling bee app. This is my foray into python in which I don't have any industry experience but trying to get sharper.

Low Hanging fruits for improvement

1. prune noise from existing dictionary
2. better dictionary (along with pruning) to potentially generate more words
3. make this a service (not necessary but can get rid of the loading phase for each solution)
