"""
    Here are the general steps you can follow:

Select four points in the image that represent the corners of the area you want to transform into a regular rectangle.
Find the coordinates of the new rectangle that you want the area to be transformed into. This can be done by specifying the width, height, and aspect ratio of the rectangle.
Use the four points you selected in step 1 and the coordinates of the new rectangle from step 2 to calculate the perspective transformation matrix.
Apply the perspective transformation to the image using the matrix calculated in step 3.
"""

"""
In this code, pts_src represents the four points in the input image and pts_dst represents the four points in the new rectangular space. The getPerspectiveTransform function is used to calculate the perspective transformation matrix, and warpPerspective is used to apply the transformation to the input image. The resulting image is saved as output_image.jpg.

Note that the coordinates of the four points should be specified in a clockwise order, starting from the top-left corner.
